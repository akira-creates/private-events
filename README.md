# Private Events
Test out the [web app here!](https://private-events-by-akira-creates.up.railway.app)

The Private Events web-app was made as part of the [Ruby on Rails curriculum from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails).
As a way to familiarise myself with Active Record Associations, [this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events) challenged me to implement a website with features much like Eventbrite.

## Features
- Allows users to sign up to start using the Private events app. (Site visitors can still view some event details) 
- Users have access to create, view, edit and delete events.
- Users can register to attend events.
- Events can be made private, so only specifically invited users can see and attend them.

## Upcoming features (WIP)
- Front-end overhaul, making the website an enjoyable experience!
- Add popular/featured events to the home page.
- Add a search bar to allow users to search for events.
- Allow users to make comments and rate events.
